# Research Plan for IRIS Call Center Authors

!-!-!-! DRAFT !-!-!-!

## Goals	

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

   Learning Center MVP, Public Websites

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

   Call center content authors currently use two things to publish articles:

   - The [Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS)](https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/) is a system used to publish external customer articles. It's accessible to Veterans, and also used VA call centers to answer customer service questions.
   - Egain is used to publish internal docs, like scripts for call center reps

   Now that IRIS is going to be retired, Veteran Experience Office (VEO) is in the process of getting the content teams onboarded into Egaines to publish internal and external content on [KnowVa](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018). KnowVA does not align with the modernized experience of VA.gov. 

   All of the existing public facing IRIS content will be migrated into the learning center. We want to support the publication of future call center author content in the learning center, instead of KnowVA.

   In order to understand how we can best support call center authors, we want to interview them to better understand the end-to-end content process.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

   - How many teams and people are creating content for call centers?
   - How do those teams and people work together?
   - What is the end-to-end current authoring experience like?
   - What determines the content that needs to be created? 
   - How do call center requests influence content creation?
   - How does collaboration with the business stakeholders fit into the content creation/authoring process?
   - Who verifies, reviews, and approves content?
   - What kind of content management life cycle processes are in place?
     - Are audit older articles audited?
     - How do content managers know when something becomes outdated, or needs to be retired?
     - What role do business stakeholders have in this process?
   - What are content author and call center requirements are as part of the authoring experience?
     - Is it important to know who the content author was?
     - How is that information used?
     - If info is identified as being wrong, is someone graded on that content?
     - Who is responsible for fixing/updating incorrect information?
     - What are the data things that are created as part of their authoring experience that is used for processes that they may have? To support grading, traceability, etc

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

   - The content authoring and management process is structured in such a way that we'll need to talk to multiple roles/people to answer our research questions.
   - The need for content creation is driven by combination of Veteran and business stakeholder needs.

## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 	

   This study will begin with moderated, ethnographic interviews conducted over Zoom.  Follow-up interview sessions may be scheduled depending on what we learn in the first round.

2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

   Direct observation of the content authors/managers doing their work will give us the clearest insights into existing processes. Asking questions will clarify what they're doing and help us determine any next steps needed to answer remaining questions.  At this point, we're not sure if we are going to ask questions as we observe, or if it'll be better to wait until the end of the session.  We will refine that after we have a better sense of what we will be observing.

## Participants and Recruitment	

1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
   We're looking to speak to call center content authors who can share insights into our research questions.  At this time, we anticipate that we'll need to talk to: 

   - 2 people in a reviewer/approver role
   - 3 people in a creator role

   This may change depending on what we learn about how teams are structured.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
   We'll work with VA call center contacts to determine the content team members that can provide insights into our questions.

## When? 	

1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
   Week of Sept 21 or Sept 28

2. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

   This will depend on who we're talking to and exactly what they'll be showing us. Sessions won't be longer than 90 minutes, to prevent fatigue.

3. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

   We won't be doing a pilot for this, but we will talk to content managers on the public websites team to help anticipate what we *might* see and come prepared with questions/things to look out for.
